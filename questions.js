// This is designed as my favorite type of mental playground- giving you just enough structure to use as a jumping off point for making your own adventures. Make this your own- add your own flair to these questions, your own constraints and stipulations and ridiculous twists (my standby is to add "with an incredible headpiece" to the end of every imagined scenario). Try asking these questions in different contexts. Ask them first for a family member, then a friend, then a lover (favorite trip with a family member, favorite trip with a friend, favorite trip with a lover). Explore and laugh and play together. The best use of this game is not to rush through and answer all the questions in a fact-finding mission, but rather to have found a single question that sparks hours and hours of story-telling and memories and playful imagination of worlds created together. 

// Many of these questions are intentionally vague- part of the fun is to see how you choose to interpret it. 

// Oh, and some of these get super personal. Feel free to skip over them, or if you're daring enough to venture into that territory, do so with empathy and understanding to give your partner the support they need to delve into those memories. 

// There be dragons, and we're going to ride them to your favorite place in the woods, while wearing an awesome feathered hat. 

// make them click- Yes, I'm game to make my own adventures from these questions!
